    <p>Western is the third college I’ve been to. As you might guess, my undergraduate experience has been far from
        traditional. Each transition has brought its own degree of confusion to my life, with the largest disorienting
        change being my transfer to Western. Where WWU struggles compared to other colleges I’ve been to is its
        organization. The school is absolutely a great fit for a student like me, with lots of opportunity to form my
        own schedules and get involved on campus from the get-go. This is a two-edged sword, however, as this lack of
        structure has made some things far more difficult. This includes things such as registering, degree planning,
        financial aid, et cetera. One of the most disorienting challenges I faced, however, was navigating the campus;
        schedules and locations just didn’t make any sense to me, compared to my previous institutions.</p>
    <p>Why are all my Computer Science classes are the Environmental Science building?</p>
    <p>Why does the math building have two fourth floors?</p>
    <p>Where are my resources in the Computer Science building?</p>
    <p>These are the questions I would ask myself everyday in those first couple quarters, and I couldn’t seem to find
        easy answers to these questions anywhere. Online resources were less than useless, as they were riddled with
        conflicting information on several different webpages. I knew that other students like me were having these same
        complications too. Whether we missed some helpful information during freshman year orientation or there’s simply
        an expectation that students will figure this stuff out for themselves, the end result is the same. Western
        Washington University is needlessly confusing for new students.</p>
    <p>To me, the most striking thing about this problem is that it’s entirely unnecessary. We have the technology. It’s
        like Western students are stuck in caves rubbing sticks together while all the other schools have electric
        lighting. What’s even more frustrating is the solution is simple: create modern web resources. It seems as
        though Western administration has placed all their effort into information architecture when they should have
        been focusing on information behavior. How are students using web resources? What are they looking for? What do
        we need to address?</p>
    <p>This is where I focused my mobile site project. As a student, I have firsthand knowledge of student’s information
        behavior. From talking with my peers I have a strong understanding of what the University’s web resources are
        lacking. I decided to target a specific building which I could work to improve with a modern interface. For
        this, I chose the building which I know best: the Communication Facility. My decision was to create an
        interactive map and informative interface to help any student navigate the Communication Facility. I also
        tailored it specifically for computer science students to help them find out which computer labs would be
        available.</p>
    <p>The webpage works like this: students are greeted with a familiar Google Maps interface upon navigating to the
        page. The Maps interface has an overlay of the Communication Facility floor plan, which shows the locations of
        all the room numbers in the building. There are a couple additional buttons for the user on the map, which
        change the overlay up one floor or down one floor, depending on which floor they are looking for. In my opinion,
        the most useful feature of the website is the search function, which will take a room number and then highlight
        the correct floor and room. This feature would be especially useful for new students, who have no idea where to
        find their classes in the Communication Facility. I anticipate this feature would remove just a bit of stress
        from a high intensity environment. The second major feature of the application is the lab availability display.
        There are a number of computer science labs open for use by students. The problem is these labs intermittently
        host class sessions, removing their availability for students. Should a student want to know if they can use a
        lab, they usually walk around the building and check every lab until they find an opening. My application solves
        this problem by displaying all the labs below the map, coloring them red or green depending on the class
        schedules for each. This feature saves students time when deciding which lab to use. The lab display will also
        guide the students to the lab of their choosing when they click on the button for that lab.</p>
    <p> Overall my website is a clean and simple solution to a common problem at Western: campus confusion. It helps
        orient students in a building that can be hectic and confusing. I believe this concept is highly scalable. I
        imagine that Western could take this idea and create an interactive map for every building on campus. Additional
        features could also increase the usability, such as current location.</p>
