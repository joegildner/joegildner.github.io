    <h1>Self Portrait Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Joe Gildner | CSCI 202 | October 7, 2019</h2>

    <p>The internet and I grew up simultaneously, and I clearly remember what it was like to browse in the early 2000s.
    Pages were rough and poorly organized, text could be difficult to read, colors clashed all around. Although I look
    back through the biased lens of nostalgia, the internet felt more interesting back then. There was so much uncharted
    land to discover. I remember stumbling over old relics from the nineties: flashing, colorful, vivid webpages. They
    looked awful, yet somehow charming. Once in a while I would stumble upon a real gem, something to show my friends
    the next day. Pages like Google Gravity, for example, which challenged the very idea of what a web page could be.</p>

    <p>Ted Nelson speaks of such Dream Machines in his work of the same title. The internet offers an endless breadth of
    possibilities; It is a medium through which developers can challenge the norms and create entirely new experiences.
    This is how I remember my early days of browsing. There were many unique and experimental websites, it was exciting
    to find new ones. But, as with the taming of the West, this chaotic internet was bound to be smoothed out. Today,
    much of the internet feels formulaic. Don’t get me wrong, websites look and feel fantastic, design concepts have
    been liberally employed. However, ease of use means standardization, thus the majority of the internet feels
    monotonous.</p>

    <p>I’m hopeful for a return to those endless creative possibilities. An internet renaissance, if you will. The modern
    internet is more robust than ever, and its standardization across all platforms is nearly complete. Plus, with the
    ever developing capabilities of JavaScript, most anything is possible through a web browser.</p>

    <p>For my self portrait I have taken Nelson’s words to heart and attempted to create a unique experience with the
    available technology. Via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I have recreated an image from my childhood. This is the living
    room from my home growing up, where I spent many hours sitting at the keyboard during my musical training. Piano is
    an integral part of my identity, and it's something I love to share with others. To reflect this, I have created a
    virtual keyboard. By clicking on the piano, it is actually possible to tinker on the keys. This is important
    because, let’s be honest, what does anybody do when they see an open piano? The room itself changes colors on every
    visit, adding to the dream-like feel of the whole page. This page is meant to be an online respite, a small way to
    break the day to day monotony and let your mind briefly escape to a new place. This is what my self portrait means
    to me, at least. Although it’s not a perfect replica of my living room back home, it allows me to access those
    memories through a new medium. This page is my dream machine.</p>
